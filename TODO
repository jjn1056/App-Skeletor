-- get rid of the wank in installing a temporary distribution
   maybe use this as an example:
   
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjn1056/bootstrap-locallib.pl/0.03/bootstrap_locallib.pl

-- allow a git repository to be the source for project
   template

-- allow hooks and configuration presets in the template
   distribution.
  -- pre build hook
  -- post build hook

-- swith to Getopt::Long before its too late....
